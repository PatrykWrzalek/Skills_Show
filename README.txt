Hello, I have finish my studies (Electrotechnics) and try to find my first job/internship of embedded programist.
I have some knowledge of programing in C, C++, Python, also use a evaluation boards like Arduino, STM32 or ESP8266.
Before I didn't use a git, because it wasn't needed to some of project I do for myself or studies.
Some of this projects I did no longer exists or was too small for me that's why I didn't want to share it.
That's why I want to show my skill level and make some applications/device which will be a recomendation for me in short while.
Yours faithfully, Patryk Wrzalek.
